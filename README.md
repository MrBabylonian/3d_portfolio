🚀 Key Features Implementation
Interactive Island Navigation
Rotatable 3D Island Hub: The island serves as a physical metaphor for your portfolio sections, allowing intuitive exploration by rotating it to discover different areas.
Stage-Based Content System: As you navigate to different points of interest, the camera transitions smoothly to reveal contextual content.
Multi-Modal Controls: Navigate using mouse drag, keyboard arrow keys, or touch gestures on mobile.
Physics-Based Interactions: Natural movement with momentum and damping for fluid rotation that mimics real-world physics.
Spatial UI Integration: UI elements appear in 3D space at specific island locations, blending the interface with the environment.
Animated Elements
Autonomous Bird: Lifelike bird that follows procedurally generated flight paths using cubic Bezier curves for natural movement.
Flying Circus Plane: Detailed aircraft with animated propeller that circles the island on a customizable flight path.
Dynamic Sky Environment: Reactive sky system that changes based on camera position with realistic cloud movement and lighting.
Custom Loading Sequences: Visually engaging loading screens with progress indicators and 3D elements to maintain immersion while assets load.
Particle Systems: Subtle environmental effects like floating particles that enhance the scene's depth and atmosphere.
Responsive Design
